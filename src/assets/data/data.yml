tips:
  - Try to have quick and concise answers.
  - Try to answer in 2 to 3 sentences.
  - Answer like you would in a conversation, this is not a presentation.
  - When talking to PG and the other YC partners, be substantive, and get straight to the point.
  - DO NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH. Do not hem and haw. "Uhm"s and "uh"s don't lend an aura of intelligence.
  - Use precise and concise language. You aren't pitching a VC that will ask you what your "secret sauce" is.
  - They talk quickly. Try to match their tempo (as you should when talking to anyone).
  - Know your numbers cold. Users, growth rate, revenue, costs - have them memorized.
  - If you don't know an answer, say so quickly and move on. Don't waste time making things up.
  - Practice with a co-founder. YC interviews are conversations, not monologues.
  - Focus on what you've built and learned, not what you plan to build.
  - Show passion and deep knowledge about your problem space.
  - Be honest about your weaknesses - they'll respect that more than BS.
  - Have specific examples ready. "We talked to 50 customers" is better than "we did customer research".
  - Quantify everything. "10x faster" is better than "much faster".
  - Know your competition deeply. Why will you win?
  - Show that you understand why this is hard and why you can do it anyway.
  - Don't oversell. Confidence is good, delusion is bad.
  - If asked about something you haven't thought about, acknowledge it and think out loud.
  - Your founding story matters. Why this team? Why this problem? Why now?
